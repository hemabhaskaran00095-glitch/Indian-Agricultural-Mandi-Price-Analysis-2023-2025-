📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes daily mandi (agricultural market) prices for five key food crops in India — Onion, Tomato, Potato, Wheat, and Rice.
The dataset spans two years (June 2023 – June 2025) and covers nearly all Indian states and districts.
The goal is to perform time-series analysis, price forecasting, and visualization to extract insights useful for farmers, traders, and policymakers.
